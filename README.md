I finished my Computer Vision, Robotics, and Machine Learning MSc at the [University of Surrey](https://www.surrey.ac.uk/) with a dissertation focusing on the reliability assessment of computer vision models. I plan to take my PhD and focus it on improving the reliability of AI models against out-of-distribution (OOD) data through Domain Generalization and Continual Learning. 

### ✨  Me in a nutshell:
* My pronouns: She/Her
